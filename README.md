## A note:
The very first time you open the page, the loading can take you from 5 to 30 seconds, that's needed to generate random data. All the next loads will take less than a second.

**All the changes you make are saved to your browser's local storage and won't be lost when you close the page or turn off the computer.**

## Description of the functionality:
1. You can filter users by date range and name, the summary information will be also updated accordingly.
2. You can enable and disable users
3. You can switch between two modes: "show only disabled" and "show only enabled" with the toggle button.
4. You can navigate to the user's profile from the table. There you can: edit the user's name, see all the time tracks, and add a new time track (it will appear as the last row of the time tracks table).
5. When you add a time track, the user's data and global summary is also updated: it's clocked time and (un)productive is increased by the duration of your track entry.
6. There's no mocked data in the app. Total numbers are a real sum of all the track's duration and all the changes you make to the user's data will be present in the dashboard view.
